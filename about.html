        <p>My name is Emma and I am a dog lover or as my family say I am dog daft! I enjoy taking my own dog - Cookie on
            walks to parks, woodland and the beach. <br> My favourite activities are walking and of course spending time
            with dogs. Any dog I
            take out will be treated as my own and we will have the best time together.</p>
